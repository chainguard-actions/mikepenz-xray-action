Action **mikepenz--xray-action/v4.2.0** was hardened automatically. 1 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### broad-permissions (severity: medium)

The workflow file scorecard.yml has a top-level `permissions: read-all` setting, which grants overly broad read access to all scopes. This should be replaced with specific minimal permissions required by each job.

Locations:

- `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml:9`

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** broad-permissions

**Notes:**

Replaced top-level `permissions: read-all` in .github/workflows/scorecard.yml with specific minimal permissions `contents: read`. The job-level permissions block already had the specific permissions needed (`security-events: write` and `id-token: write`), so only the top-level broad permission needed to be narrowed.
